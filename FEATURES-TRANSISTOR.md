# Transistor.fm Integration

## Your Podcast, Seamlessly Connected to WordPress

PodLoom connects directly to your Transistor.fm account, making it effortless to embed episodes on your WordPress site. Browse your shows, pick an episode, and publish—all without leaving the WordPress editor.

## How It Works

### Connect Once, Embed Anytime

Add your Transistor API key to PodLoom settings and you're connected. From that moment on, every show and episode in your Transistor account is available at your fingertips inside WordPress.

No copying embed codes. No switching between browser tabs. No manual updates when you publish new episodes.

### Browse Your Shows in the Editor

When you add a PodLoom block to your page, you'll see a dropdown of all your Transistor shows. Select one, and your episodes appear instantly—complete with titles, publish dates, and artwork thumbnails.

Looking for a specific episode? Use the search field to filter by title. Publishing a lot? Pagination keeps everything organized.

### Three Ways to Display

**Latest Episode**
Always shows your most recent release. Perfect for your homepage or sidebar—it updates automatically when you publish.

**Specific Episode**
Hand-pick exactly which episode to feature. Ideal for show notes pages, guest posts, or highlighting your best content.

**Playlist**
Display multiple episodes in a browsable list. Visitors can click any episode to start listening, and playback continues to the next episode automatically.

### Live Preview

See exactly how your episode will look before you publish. The WordPress editor shows a real preview of your player, so you can adjust settings and see changes in real time.

## What You'll Need

### A Transistor.fm Account

PodLoom's Transistor integration requires an active Transistor.fm account. If you're already hosting your podcast on Transistor, you're ready to connect.

New to Transistor? They offer a 14-day free trial to get started.

### Your API Key

Your API key is how PodLoom securely accesses your show and episode data. You'll find it in your Transistor dashboard under Account Settings.

The key stays on your WordPress site and is never shared. PodLoom uses it only to fetch your podcast information—nothing is modified in your Transistor account.

## Bonus: Automatic Subscribe Links

When you connect your Transistor API key, PodLoom can automatically import your subscribe links. If you've configured Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and other platform links in Transistor, they'll be ready to use in PodLoom's Subscribe Buttons block.

One connection. Everything synced.

## Getting Started

1. **Get your API key** from your Transistor dashboard (Account → API)
2. **Add it to PodLoom** in Settings → PodLoom → General
3. **Create a new post or page** and add the PodLoom Episode block
4. **Select your show and episode** from the dropdown
5. **Publish** and your episode is live

The whole process takes about two minutes.

## Don't Use Transistor?

No problem. PodLoom also works with any podcast RSS feed. If you host with Buzzsprout, Captivate, Libsyn, Podbean, or any other platform, you can add your RSS feed URL and get the same great player experience—including full Podcasting 2.0 support.
